                The basic functions of the designer, over the years, have remained the same. However, the junction of graphic design with technology, which has been emerging recently, has expanded the range of possibilities in the world of design and enthuses new creators to discover areas still little explored.
                In this dissertation we intend to explore the idea that, with the integration of rules and principles of graphic design in the system inherent in the Graphic Ground tool, it is possible to generate various graphic materials for dissemination. By automating the design process, it becomes possible for people with no previous contact with similar tools to use it, or even for designers looking for a creative outlet.
                This generation of materials is possible on the online platform Graphic Ground, which aims to be used by a wide range of people. In addition to the application of graphic design principles in the generation of materials, these are generated according to the data and choices of the user, who can also, in an easy way, modify the material generated by the system, participating as an author of the generated compositions.
